What is a decibel?

taking tangent from HW solutions because this is important to the content

10*log_10(A/B)
or
20*log_10(A/B)

yes but 2 fundamental things about Db you shoud know

1 dB = 1/10 * Bel
10 dB = 1 bel
a bel is  order of magnitude, or ratios of 10:1

10:1 = 1 bel
100:1 = 2 bel

A/B = 10^n, where n = num bels

good for describing quantities over wide varietys of range
and math shortcuts 

eyeballing:
3 dB ~ 2:1
10 dB = 10:1 

3 things people get wrong with dB:
1. fail to tell what db is relative to. e.g. dBmike taller than me
2. amplitude vs power (I have screwed this up in ECE302)
	power is the amp^2, where 10log10 and 20log10 come from
	when describing amp, only describe amps
	when describing power, only describe power
	otherwise you have to track all the maths
3. Negatives
	-5 dB loss (would be positive, is a gain)
	5 dB loss
