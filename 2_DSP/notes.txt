Analog vs digital signals represented in time (stem/dots for digital)
likes x because faster to draw

sampler/ADC that samples the signal at discrete time periods

throttle block:

Homework:
1. Create a flowgraph like the one in the video or the screenshot below.

2. Does the flowgraph behave differently if you remove the throttle block? (Connect the source directly to the sink.)
A: not super visible, open htop for analysis. throttle limits CPU coming from a
file. Only throttle block limits realtime rate of the flow graph.

3. Does the FFT sink correctly indicate the frequency produced by the source? What if the source and sink have different sample rates configured?
A: Yes. But if different sample rates, no. But it does do the exact same
analysis just with a different ruler. 
See lesson 4 Aliasing (1st section)

4. What happens if you configure the signal source with various frequencies between 0 and 16k?
A: slides around as expected. see lesson 4 ~30:00

5. What if you specify frequencies greater than 16k? Any idea why?
A: the 'Atari effect', periodic about the boundaries

6. What if you specify negative frequencies? Mathematically, is there a
difference between cos(x) and cos(-x)
A: no. Not for cos() (it is symmetric about the y-axis)

7. Does the plot indicate the presence of any frequencies other than the one produced by the source? (Hint: Use Autoscale or increase dB/Div.) What is the apparent amplitude of the noise? Why is there any noise at all?
A: types, and quantization error from different ones, see section

8. Try multiple signal sources added together. Are there any other interesting operations you could try?

9. Try various waveforms (instead of cosine) in the signal source.
