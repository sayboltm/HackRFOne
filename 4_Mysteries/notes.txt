See Lesson 2/HW

Aliasing and our sample rates:
when using scope plot, beware continuous line, use dot large 

sample rate to throttle block is the real time rate the flowgraph should run
only doles out output samples at rate specified

but to signal source, doesn't care about realtime rates
just ratio between sample rate and frequency

to the fft sink, the sample rate affects the ruler/x-scale
	if set very high, there is a delay with its refresh rate
		by default, 15 frames/s
		will mess up refresh rate
		see ~23:00

set all the sample rates the same, things will generally work correctly


types:
short is a 16 bit int, int 32 bit, float is floating point/decimal as 32 bit
float, complex is 2 floats(?)
throttle block has 8 bit byte as well
2^8 = 256 values in a byte

quantization error:
this is where the noise from our synthesized cosine wave comes from
using less bits to represent the data, increases this, increasing noise
could use double precision 64 bit float (but not in grc)
we can pick the noise floor, we don't have as easily with analog RF signals


HW (more lesson 2 HW for lesson 4 HW):
1. Add a scope sink
2. How does scope and FFT change if you change data type from complex to float?
3. When using float, what happens if specify negative source frequency? How
does that differ from the behavior when using the complex data type?
