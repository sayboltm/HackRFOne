General:
beware type incomatiblities, make sure types/colors match
D key to disable
OOOOOOOOO = overrun your comp isn't keeping up with the data coming from HackRF
	only a problem if its continuous/frequently happening
recommends clicking stop button instead of closing foreground window

Lesson content:
in osmocom source:
	set Ch0: RF Gain (dB) to 0, turn off frontend LNA near antenna in
hackRF. Good to leave off unless in situation where need to pick up a very weak
signal

FFT sink, set baseband freq to a center_freq or whatever you are tuning to
	it is just the scale

Can tune the hackRF, or we can do it in software using multiply operator
multiply signal by a cosine of frequency that we want to shift 

Why do we do center_freq - channel_freq? allows shift away from DC spike

Decimation related to amount of bandwith required to get signal
	we decimate in the LPF
	reduces sample rate, samp_rate/channel_width
channel_width - set to 200 kHz 

resampler: interp 12, decimate 5, 

WBFM Rx
quadrature rate - sample rate of imput
audio decimation - how much to futher decimate
	reduce to 480
	most of flowgraph at 10 M, LPF /50 to 200k, *12/5 = 480k, 480k/10 is
48k, great for sound cards

Math operator multiply Const used to adjust audio gain
